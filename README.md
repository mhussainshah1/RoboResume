Write a program that will display a resume in an organized format.
The resume must allow any user to enter and display:

- an email address, 
- a phone number,
- zero or more educational achievements each of which contain a school and a year and a degree and major,
- zero or more experiences each contains a company, title, date and description,
- zero or more skills - each with a Competency Proficiency rating (Fundamental, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
- Each data element must be either a String or other object, or a collection. All data must be input and output in in the main method only. The output will be displayed using the Java console. 

Your project MUST contain multiple classes, implement composition and display in a format *close* to that shown below.

This application should be able to capture information for multiple people.
